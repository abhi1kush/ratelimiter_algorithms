Rate Limiter in Golang

ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project implements a rate limiter in Golang, inspired by Alex Xu's "System Design Interview" book. Rate limiting is essential for controlling API access, preventing abuse, and ensuring fair resource allocation.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… Token Bucket Algorithm: Efficient rate-limiting mechanism.

âœ… Fixed Window Algorithm: Simple implementation with a reset period.

âœ… Sliding Window Log Algorithm: Provides more accurate rate-limiting decisions.

âœ… Sliding Window Counter Algorithm: Acheives more accurate rate-limiting decisions by considering previous window.
